| command   | description |
| --------- | ----------- |

| score     | For OBJECT_LOCALIZATION, get the score(s) for the object specified with "look-for". |

Just like the main library, any responses provided by the above commands will be given in the JSON format.  So ideally, you will want to use a command line json parser to interpret the results.  The recommended json parser for this purpose is [_jq_](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).  With _jq_ you can process the results of a command as follows:

## Quick start

```sh
#step 1 - setup default default JWT credentials
cp my_creds.json ~/.vision/cfredentials.json

#step 2
vision highlight --features OBJECT_LOCALIZATION --image-file my_source_image.jpg --output-file result.jpg
```

## detect

```sh
prompt>vision detect --help
Run image detection and annotation for an images.

Usage: vision detect [arguments]
-h, --help                                        Print this usage information.
    --image-file=<image file path> (mandatory)    The path to the file that will be processed.
    --features (mandatory)                        Comma separated list of detections to be done on the image. See [https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/Feature#Type]
    --max-results=<number>                        The maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. Acceptable values are 0 to 50, inclusive. The default value is 10.
                                                  (defaults to "10")
```
